Files temporarily moved to OLD folder.

 - innerproduct_zeroforms
        Jacobian is treated slightly different
        Jacobian is made sparse earlier. Speed difference?
 - innerproduct_oneforms
        Jacobian is treated slightly different
        Jacobian is made sparse earlier. Speed difference?
 - innerproduct_twoforms
        Completely different implementation. Check consistency.

innerproduct_assembly:
 - why for 0-forms Ne and for 1- and 2-forms Ne^2 ?

Check if innerproduct_assembly_tmp.m does the same as innerproduct_assembly.m

Check if innerproduct_assembly_v2 is ever used. Looks like it is not finished.
